# 5551
CSCI 5551 - Introduction to Intelligent Robotic Systems


## Proposal
#### Due Date: 10/13/15


### Setting up Latex on your own computer
Get MiKTeX from here for compiling Latex documents (it's free):
 * http://miktex.org/download

Get the Latex IDE texmaker from here (it's also free):
 * http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/


The Texmaker IDE makes recompiling to PDF format really easy once you have everything set up.  It also performs like an IDE, providing suggestions when entering in commands as well as a lot of built-ins to make life easier.
