\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{Exercise 5.13}
A certain two-link manipulator has the follow Jacobian:
\[
\tensor*[^{0}]{J(\Theta)}{} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    -l_{1}s_{1} - l_{2}s_{12}    & -l_{2}s_{12}   \\
    l_{1}c_{1}+l_{2}c_{12}      & l_{2}c_{12}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Ignoring gravity, what are the joint torques required in order that the manipulator will apply a static force vector \(\tensor*[^{0}]{F}{} = 10 \hat{X_{0}}\).
\subsubsection*{Answer}
To solve this problem, we will use Equation (5.97) on p.157 in \cite{textbook}, which is as follows:
\[
\tau = \tensor*[^{0}]{J}{^T} \tensor*[^{0}]{F}{}
\]
Next, we set up the values (Note: Since the manipulator only has 2-DOF, the \(\hat{X_{0}}\) vector only contains an \(x\) and \(y\) component):
\[
\tensor*[^{0}]{J}{^T} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    -l_{1}s_{1} - l_{2}s_{12}    & -l_{2}s_{12}   \\
    l_{1}c_{1}+l_{2}c_{12}      & l_{2}c_{12}
\end{bmatrix}^T
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    -l_{1}s_{1} - l_{2}s_{12}    & l_{1}c_{1}+l_{2}c_{12}    \\
    -l_{2}s_{12}     & l_{2}c_{12}
\end{bmatrix},
\tensor*[^{0}]{F}{} =
10\hat{X_{0}} =
10
\begin{bmatrix}
    1     \\
    0     \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    10     \\
    0     \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Now, we can enter the values above into our equation and solve \(\tau\), which can be seen in the following:
\[
\tau = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    -l_{1}s_{1} - l_{2}s_{12}    & l_{1}c_{1}+l_{2}c_{12}    \\
    -l_{2}s_{12}     & l_{2}c_{12}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    10     \\
    0     \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    -10 l_{1}s_{1} - 10 l_{2}s_{12}     \\
    -10 l_{2}s_{12}    \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus, the joint torques required in order for the manipulator to apply a static force vector \(\tensor*[^{0}]{F}{} = 10 \hat{X_{0}}\) is as follows:
\[
\tau = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    -10 l_{1}s_{1} - 10 l_{2}s_{12}     \\
    -10 l_{2}s_{12}    \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\pagebreak
\subsection*{Exercise 5.19}
The position of the origin of link 2 for an RP manipulator is given by
\[
\tensor*[^{0}]{P}{_{2ORG}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    a_{1}c_{1} - d_{2}s_{1}     \\
    a_{1}s_{1} + d_{2}c_{1}     \\
    0
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Give the \(2 \times 2\) Jacobian that relates the two joint rates to the linear velocity of the origin of frame {2}. Give a value of \(\Theta\) where the device is at a singularity.
\subsubsection*{Answer}
To compute the Jacobian matrix, we need to obtain the derived angular and linear components of \(\tensor*[^{0}]{P}{_{2ORG}}\) with respects to \(\dot{\theta}\) and \(\dot{d}\), respectively.  To do this, we derive for \({d}\over{d\theta}\) to find \(\omega\) and for \({d}\over{dd}\) to find \(v\), which produces the following (Note: The Z-component is removed since the manipulator only contains 2-DOF):
\[
\tensor*[^{0}]{\omega}{_{2}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    -\dot{\theta}a_{1}s_{1} - \dot{\theta}d_{2}c_{1}     \\
    \dot{\theta}a_{1}c_{1} - \dot{\theta}d_{2}s_{1}
\end{bmatrix},
\tensor*[^{0}]{v}{_{2}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    - \dot{d}_{2}s_{1}     \\
    \dot{d}_{2}c_{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Now, to get the \(2 \times 2\) Jacobian matrix, we side stack the components with \(\dot{\theta}\) and \(\dot{d}\) factored out, producing:
\[
J =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \tensor*[^{0}]{\omega}{_{2}}  \over {\dot{\theta}_{1}}  &
    \tensor*[^{0}]{v}{_{2}} \over \dot{d}_{2}
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    -a_{1}s_{1} - d_{2}c_{1} & -s_{1} \\
    a_{1}c_{1} - d_{2}s_{1}  & c_{1}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
To compute the singularities, we use Equation (5.73) on p.152 in \cite{textbook}, which is as follows:
\[DET[J(\Theta)] = 0\]
Thus, we compute the determinant of the \(2 \times 2\) Jacobian matrix, set it equal to 0, and solve for each value, seen in the following:
\[
-c_{1}^2d_{2} - a_{1}s_{1}c_{1} + a_{1}s_{1}c_{1} - d_{2}s_{1}^2 = 0
\]
\[
-d_{2}(c_{1}^2 + s_{1}^2) = 0
\]
\[
-d_{2} = 0
\]
Thus, a singularity exists in the RP Manipulator when the following is true:
\[
d_{2} = 0
\]

\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{Exercise 6.14}
The following equations were derived for a 2-DOF RP manipulator:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
    \tau_{1} = m_{1}(d^{2}_{1} + d_{2})\ddot{\theta}_1 + 
				m_{2} d^{2}_{2}\ddot{\theta}_{1} + 
				2m_{2}d_{2}\dot{d}_{2}\dot{\theta}_{1} +
				g cos(\theta_{1})[m_{1}(d_{1} + d_{2}\dot{\theta}_{1}) + m_{2}(d_{2} + \dot{d}_{2})]\\ \\
    \tau_{2} = m_{1}\dot{d}_{2}\ddot{\theta}_{1} + m_{2}\ddot{d}_{2} - m_{1}d_{1}\dot{d}_2 - m_{2}d_{2}\dot{\theta}^2 + m_{2}(d_{2} + 1)g sin(\theta_{1})
\end{array}
\]
Some of the terms are obviously incorrect. Indicate the incorrect terms.
\subsubsection*{Answer}
Both \(\tau_{1}\) and \(\tau_{2}\) should be similar to Equation (6.88) on p.185 in \cite{textbook} since they were also derived for an RP manipulator. This also means that they can be used as a reference to correct the provided equations in Exercise 6.14. First, we know that \(l_{1}\) must translate to \(d_{1}\). Second, through some comparison, we can see that \(d_{2}\) maps directly from Equation (6.88). \\ \\
For \(\tau_{1}\):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Term \(- m_{2}d_{2}\dot{\theta}^2\) contains the variable \(\dot{\theta}^2\), which is missing a subscript.
\end{enumerate}
For \(\tau_{2}\):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Term \(- m_{2}d_{2}\dot{\theta}^2\) contains the variable \(\dot{\theta}^2\), which is missing a subscript.
\item Term \(m_{1}\dot{d}_{2}\ddot{\theta}_{1}\) is incorrect, since \(\tau_{2}\) should not contain value \(m_{1}\).
\item Term \(- m_{1}d_{1}\dot{d}_2\) is incorrect, since \(\tau_{2}\) should not contain value \(m_{1}\).
\item Term \(m_{2}(d_{2} + 1)g sin(\theta_{1})\) should be \(m_{2}g sin(\theta_{1})\)
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 3} %%COMPLETE%%
\subsection*{Exercise 7.17}
A single cubic trajectory is given by \\
\[
\theta(t) = 10 + 90t^2 - 60t^3
\]
\\
and is used over the time interval from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 1\). What are the starting and final positions, velocities, and accelerations?
\subsubsection*{Answer}
To get the starting position, we solve for \(\theta(t)\), when \(t = 0\):
\[\theta(0) = 10 + 90(0)^2 - 60(0)^3 = 10\]
To get the final position, we solve for \(\theta(t)\), when \(t = 1\):
\[\theta(1) = 10 + 90(1)^2 - 60(1)^3 = 40\]
An order to obtain velocity, \(\dot{\theta}(t)\) will need to be computed by taking the derivative of \(\theta(t)\), which produces:
\[\dot{\theta}(t) = 180t - 180t^2\]
To get the starting velocity, we solve for \(\dot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 0\):
\[\dot{\theta}(0) = 180(0) - 180(0)^2 = 0\]
To get the final velocity, we solve for \(\dot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 1\):
\[\dot{\theta}(1) = 180(1) - 180(1)^2 = 0\]
An order to obtain acceleration, \(\ddot{\theta}(t)\) will need to be computed by taking the derivative of \(\dot{\theta}(t)\), which produces:
\[\ddot{\theta}(t) = 180 - 360t\]
To get the starting acceleration, we solve for \(\ddot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 0\):
\[\ddot{\theta}(0) = 180 - 360(0) = 180\]
To get the final acceleration, we solve for \(\ddot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 1\):
\[\ddot{\theta}(1) = 180 - 360(1) = -180\]
Thus, the starting position (\(d_i\)), final position (\(d_f\)), starting velocity (\(v_i\)), final velocity (\(v_f\)), starting acceleration (\(a_i\)), and final acceleration (\(a_f\)) are:
\[
\begin{array}{lrllr}
    d_i = &10 &,& d_f = &40  \\
    v_i = &0  &,& v_f = &0   \\
    a_i = &180 &,& a_f = &-180 \\
\end{array}
\]

\subsection*{Exercise 7.18}
A single cubic trajectory is given by \\
\[
\theta(t) = 10 + 90t^2 - 60t^3
\]
\\
and is used over the time interval from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 2\). What are the starting and final positions, velocities, and accelerations?
\subsubsection*{Answer}
To get the starting position, we solve for \(\theta(t)\), when \(t = 0\):
\[\theta(0) = 10 + 90(0)^2 - 60(0)^3 = 10\]
To get the final position, we solve for \(\theta(t)\), when \(t = 2\):
\[\theta(2) = 10 + 90(2)^2 - 60(2)^3 = -110\]
An order to obtain velocity, \(\dot{\theta}(t)\) will need to be computed by taking the derivative of \(\theta(t)\), which produces:
\[\dot{\theta}(t) = 180t - 180t^2\]
To get the starting velocity, we solve for \(\dot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 0\):
\[\dot{\theta}(0) = 180(0) - 180(0)^2 = 0\]
To get the final velocity, we solve for \(\dot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 2\):
\[\dot{\theta}(2) = 180(2) - 180(2)^2 = -360\]
An order to obtain acceleration, \(\ddot{\theta}(t)\) will need to be computed by taking the derivative of \(\dot{\theta}(t)\), which produces:
\[\ddot{\theta}(t) = 180 - 360t\]
To get the starting acceleration, we solve for \(\ddot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 0\):
\[\ddot{\theta}(0) = 180 - 360(0) = 180\]
To get the final acceleration, we solve for \(\ddot{\theta}(t)\), when \(t = 2\):
\[\ddot{\theta}(2) = 180 - 360(2) = -540\]
Thus, the starting position (\(d_i\)), final position (\(d_f\)), starting velocity (\(v_i\)), final velocity (\(v_f\)), starting acceleration (\(a_i\)), and final acceleration (\(a_f\)) are:
\[
\begin{array}{lrllr}
    d_i = &10 &,& d_f = &-110  \\
    v_i = &0  &,& v_f = &-360  \\
    a_i = &180 &,& a_f = &-540 \\
\end{array}
\]

\section*{Problem 4}
Assume that you have a mobile robot which is depicted as a point inside a room. A camera at the ceiling monitors the whole space and can track the robot and monitor the locations of the obstacles. The robot starts from an entrance at the left of the room and needs to reach an exit at the right of the room. There are two obstacles in its way. How are you going to quantize the space in order for the robot to avoid the obstacles? Can you design a planning mechanism for this case? Does this formulation change when the robot moves through a maze?
